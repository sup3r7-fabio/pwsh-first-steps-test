- ✅ Data selection and transformation with `Select-Object`
- ✅ Sorting and organizing data with `Sort-Object` and `Group-Object`
- ✅ Building complex data processing chains
- ✅ Performance optimization techniques

### Course Structure
1. **Pipeline Basics** - Understanding object flow
2. **Filtering Data** - Using `Where-Object` effectively  
3. **Selecting Properties** - Transforming and reshaping data
4. **Sorting & Grouping** - Organizing information
5. **Advanced Techniques** - Complex pipeline patterns

## 🎓 How It Works

This course uses **GitHub Skills** format for interactive learning:

1. **Read the Instructions** - Each step in README.md provides theory and exercises
2. **Create Your Scripts** - Write PowerShell scripts following the examples  
3. **Push Your Changes** - GitHub Actions automatically validate your work
4. **Get Instant Feedback** - Automated tests ensure your code works correctly
5. **Progress Automatically** - Move to the next step when validation passes

### GitHub Actions Integration
Each script you create triggers automated validation:
- ✅ **Syntax Check** - Ensures your PowerShell is valid
- ✅ **Concept Validation** - Verifies you're using the right commands
- ✅ **Execution Test** - Runs your script to ensure it works
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Advances you to the next step
